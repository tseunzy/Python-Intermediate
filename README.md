**Recursion**
    Base Case: Stopping condition to prevent infinite recursion
    Recursive Case: Function calls itself with modified parameters
    Call Stack: How recursive calls are managed
    Optimization: Memoization and tail recursion

**Map, Filter, Reduce, Zip, Enumerate**
    Map: Apply function to every element
    Filter: Keep elements meeting condition
    Reduce: Accumulate values into single result
    Zip: Combine multiple sequences
    Enumerate: Add index counter to iteration

**Error handling (try/except/finally)**
