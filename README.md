**Recursion**
    Base Case: Stopping condition to prevent infinite recursion
    Recursive Case: Function calls itself with modified parameters
    Call Stack: How recursive calls are managed
    Optimization: Memoization and tail recursion

**Map, Filter, Reduce, Zip, Enumerate**
    Map: Apply function to every element
    Filter: Keep elements meeting condition
    Reduce: Accumulate values into single result
    Zip: Combine multiple sequences
    Enumerate: Add index counter to iteration

**Error handling (try/except/finally)**
    try: Code that might raise exceptions
    except: Handle specific exceptions
    else: Run if no exception occurred
    finally: Always execute (cleanup code)
    raise: Manually trigger exceptions

**File handling (Read/Write)**
    File Modes: r (read), w (write), a (append), b (binary)
    Context Managers: with open() as file: (auto-closes)
    Reading Methods: read(), readline(), readlines()
    Writing Methods: write(), writelines()
    File Positioning: seek(), tell()
